# MX_Soccer_STDMs_Lab3
For this assignment, I was told to develope two maps, one on the earthquakes that happen in and around Japan and another
that showed two geojson data sets.

## Mexican Stadiums

I chose to do my map on the Mexican Soccer League Stadiums. I was able to find a data set with the information for all of the soccer
stadiums in the world and I went ahead and extracted the information that I deemed most worth to me. I got all of Mexico's professional
stadium information and then was able to organize and data wrangle the content onto a .csv file. Initially, I faced the issue of not having
a proper csv, but eventually, I was able to convert it right and then export the .csv file into a geojson using QGIS.The other data set I
got was the outlining of Mexico. This was easy to find online and was the least of my worries.

## Trouble Shooting
What did prove to be a difficult task and one that I don't know how to solve was the sort button. I managed to put a sort button on my site
but it never was able to function properlly. I went through and tried to modify and change the code but it only made me site crash. I resorted
 to leaving the code I got from github as was so that my site could function properly, even without the button.

I managed to get my table to show well on my site, but for some reason, the table for the earthquakes wasn't able to appear. I literraly didn't do anything to
the table. If anything, it confused me because the earthquake data was given to me, as well as the basic template for the website I needed to make. So, it
didn't make sense why the site wasn't able to display the table or the sort button. The map seemed to be the only thing to actually come through well.
